        <p>Leyland Mill Fishery is a family owned, private member fishery located on the outskirts of St. Helens and
          Wigan. Nestled away in a tree lined garden behind Leyland Mill House is the lake which offers two double pegs,
          both fitted with heated cabins so you can leave the bivvy at home and makes it a perfect place to fish all
          year round. The pegs are stoned and nice and clean with wooden jetties so your luggage won't be covered in
          mud. All nets, cradles and slings are provided.
          <br>Whilst relaxing waiting for the fish to bite you may be entertained by the regular visits from one of the
          herons or kingfishers.
          <br>We also have a range of bait and tackle on site, take a look around our website and we hope to welcome you
          to Leyland Mill in the future, tight lines all!
